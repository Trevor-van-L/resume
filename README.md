Feel free to copy and modify this template for your own resume. Shoot me a message if you do something cool with it.

### How to use:

1. [Install TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) for XeTeX

2. $ `xelatex resume`

I currently use [TeXworks](https://tug.org/texworks/) when I have a GUI, and SumatraPDF (Which does not lock the file for edits while resume is open)

Two-column method borrowed from [deedy-resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume). (**Caveat**: This does not work for resumes longer than 1 page. Let me know if you find a nice way to fix that.)

Initial constructs & fonts borrowed from [Alessandro Plasmati's template](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/professional-cv)
